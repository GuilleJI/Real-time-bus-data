Fetch real-time transit data using API 

For this project I decided to opt to caption a real-life transit data via Halifax Transit open data. Halifax Transit has launched the General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) open data feed for developers as a beta release. This data is used by Google and other third-party developers to create apps for use by the public.
